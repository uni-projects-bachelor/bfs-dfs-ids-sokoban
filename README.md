# Sokoban - BFS, DFS, and IDS Algorithms

This project implements popular search algorithms for the **Sokoban game**:

- **Breadth-first Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-first Search (DFS)**
- **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**

The algorithms are applied to solve Sokoban puzzle configurations.

## Features:
- Implementations of BFS, DFS, and IDS.
- Game logic for Sokoban puzzle-solving.
-
